    "question4":"How does Mobile Massage vet the therapists in its network?",
    "answer4":"We’re very careful about the massage therapists we select to join the Mobile Massage network. We interview all of our therapists in person and make sure they are fully licensed and insured in their state of practice. We accept only the highest quality therapists with a history of excellence in customer satisfaction. In most states the process to become a certified massage therapist (CMT) requires applicants to successfully pass background checks conducted by a state investigator, before being deemed able to safely work with the public. All Mobile Massages therapists have passed these government sponsored certification measures. In order to become a CMT, a therapist must also complete a minimum of 500 hours of practical training, but some states require as much as 1,000 hours. All Mobile Massage massages therapists have the highest level of integrity and professionalism. In return, we expect all clients to reciprocate the same level of respect and conduct.",

    "question7":"How much clothing should I remove?",
    "answer7":"Feel free to undress to your level of comfort. If you’d prefer to leave on undergarments, be our guest! If you feel more comfortable nude, you may undress completely and position your body under the sheet. Therapists are trained to properly drape your body to protect your modesty and theirs.",
